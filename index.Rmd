## Project thoughts

I am unsure of what exactly I want to explore in this project. I am potentially interested in exploring data related to racial disparities. I would also be interested into political data related to polarization. Because I live in Utah, I think it would be interesting to explore political data related to recent bills blocking gender affirming care. I'd also perhaps be interested in looking at data related to socioeconomic or racial disparities in the water crisis in Utah.
